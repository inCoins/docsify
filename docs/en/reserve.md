#Federal Reserve

> The unified management community has issued but not yet allocated money

* The Federal Reserve establishes a committee, which is composed of 8 persons: chief adviser, judicial adviser, administrative adviser, judicial adviser, chief justice, prime minister, Senate President and house speaker

* Multi signature technology is used to manage all reserves in the community to avoid the risk of loss of all reserves due to the loss of single key

* 5-8 multiple signatures are adopted, and the reserve fund can be used only with the consent of 5 people

**Advisory panel**

* In the chaotic stage of the community, the president leads the overall work of the community start-up. The big judiciary is responsible for establishing the legislative body, the big administration is responsible for establishing the administrative body, and the big judgment is responsible for establishing the judicial body

* After the community transited from chaos to dawn, the president changed into the chief adviser, the great justice changed into the judicial adviser, the great administration changed into the administrative adviser, and the great judgment changed into the trial adviser
